## Get help
**man {command}** -> manual on a command.\
**whatis {command}** -> short description of a command.

## List a directory
**ls {path}** ->  It's ok to combine attributes, eg ls -laF gets a long listing of all files with types.\
**ls {path_1} {path_2}** -> List both {path_1} and {path_2}.\
**ls -l {path}** -> Long listing, with date, size and permisions.\
**ls -a {path}** -> Show all files, including important .dot files that don't otherwise show.\
**ls -F {path}** -> Show type of each file. "/" = directory, "\*" = executable.\
**ls -R {path}** -> Recursive listing, with all subdirs.\
**ls {path} | more** -> Show listing one screen at a time.

## Change to directory
**cd {dirname}** -> There must be a space between.\
**cd \~** -> Go back to home directory, useful if you're lost.\
**cd ..** -> Go back one directory.

## Make a new directory
**mkdir {dirname}**

## Remove a directory
**rmdir {dirname}** -> Only works if {dirname} is empty.\
**rm -r {dirname}** -> Remove all files and subdirs. Careful!

## Print working directory
**pwd** -> Show where you are as full path. Useful if you're lost or exploring.

## Copy a file or directory
**cp {file1} {file2}**\
**cp -r {dir1} {dir2}** -> Recursive, copy directory and all subdirs.\
**cat {newfile} >> {oldfile}** -> Append newfile to end of oldfile.

## Move (or rename) a file
**mv {oldfile} {newfile}** -> Moving a file and renaming it are the same thing.\
**mv {oldname} {newname}**

## Delete a file
**rm {filespec}** -> ? and * wildcards work like DOS should. "?" is any character; "\*" is any string of characters.\
**ls {filespec}** -> Good strategy: first list a group to make sure it's what's you think...\
**rm {filespec}** -> ...then delete it all at once.

## View a text file
**more {filename}** -> View file one screen at a time.\
**less {filename}** -> Like more, with extra features.\
**cat {filename}** -> View file, but it scrolls.\
**cat {filename} | more** -> View file one screen at a time.

## Edit a text file.
**gedit {filename}** -> Basic text editor

## Create a text file.
**cat > {filename}** -> Enter your text (multiple lines with enter are ok) and press control-d to save.\
**gedit {filename}** -> Create some text and save it.

## Compare two files
**diff {file1} {file2}** -> Show the differences.\
**sdiff {file1} {file2}** -> Show files side by side.

## Other text commands
**grep '{pattern}' {file}** -> Find regular expression in file.\
**spell {file}** -> Display misspelled words.\
**wc {file}** -> Count words in file.\
**wc -l {file}** -> Count the number of lines in a file.

## Make an Alias
**alias {name}='{command}'** -> Put the command in 'single quotes'. More useful in your .bashrc file.

## Wildcards and Shortcuts
**\***    -> Match any string of characters, eg **page\*** gets page1, page10, and page.txt.\
**?**     -> Match any single character, eg **page?** gets page1 and page2, but not page10.\
**[...]** -> Match any characters in a range, eg **page[1-3]** gets page1, page2, and page3.\
**\~**    -> Short for your home directory, eg **cd \~** will take you home, and **rm -r \~** will destroy it.\
**.**     -> The current directory.\
**..**    -> One directory up the tree, eg **ls ...**

## Pipes and Redirection
(You **pipe** a command to another command, and **redirect** it to a file.)\
**{command} > {file}** -> Redirect output to a file, eg **ls > list.txt** writes directory to file.\
**{command} >> {file}** -> Append output to an existing file, eg **cat update >> archive** adds update to end of archive.\
**{command} < {file}** -> Get input from a file, eg **sort < file.txt**\
**{command} < {file1} > {file2}** -> Get input from file1, and write to file2, eg **sort < old.txt > new.txt** sorts old.txt and saves as new.txt.\
**{command} | {command}** -> Pipe one command to another, eg **ls | more** gets directory and sends it to **more** to show it one page at a time.

## System info
**date** -> Show date and time.\
**df** -> Check system disk capacity.\
**du** -> Check your disk usage and show bytes in each directory.\
**du -h** -> Check your disk usage in a human readable format\
